# A Car Buying Site

* This is a small-scale project  built to showcase the use of HTML,CSS with the assistance of a framework (Bootstrap v5) & vanilla JavaScript in creating a responsive,accessible and interactive car buying site .
* The above front-end languages are utilised to build a mock of a popular car buying site with limited functionality.
* The site lacks the backend portion therefore warrants it as a static website .
