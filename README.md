# A Car Buying Site 
* This is a small-scale project  built to showcase the use of HTML,CSS &  vanilla JAVASCRIPT in creating a responsive and interactive car buying site .
* The above front-end languages will be utilised to build a mock of a popular car buying site with limited functionality.
* This site lacks the backend portion therefore warrants it as a static website .
